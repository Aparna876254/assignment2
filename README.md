## Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an **if-else** statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### Functionality:
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2.
  - If yes → the number is **Even**.
  - Otherwise → the number is **Odd**.
- The result is displayed to the user in a clear message.

## Task 4: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a **for loop** to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### Functionality:
- The program initializes a sum variable as `0`.
- A `for` loop is used to add each number from 1 to 50.
- After the loop finishes, the total sum is displayed.
- This demonstrates the use of loops for repetitive addition.
